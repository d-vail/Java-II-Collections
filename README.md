# Java II - IntelliJ and Language Fundamentals
### Collections

Guided demo for [Java II Lecture.](./Java-II.pdf)

Goals of this module are to:
- Use IntelliJ to enter source code, generate bytecode, prepare a shippable application (JAR file), execute that
  application and view the applicationâ€™s output.
- Use IntelliJ, open a preexisting project, fix errors (bugs), and continue the process to execute an application (JAR)
  file.
- Craft and manipulate Arrays, and collections with initializers including ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap.
